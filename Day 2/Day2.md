# üêû Bug Bounty Journey ‚Äì Day 2 

---

## üéØ Objective
Begin mastering **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities by learning the theory, watching real-world demos, and solving hands-on labs from PortSwigger Academy.

## üé• Learning Summary

- Watched [**XSS Vulnerabilities ‚Äì NahamSec**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8zKkQ1VTMI), which explained:
  - Different types of XSS (Reflected, Stored, DOM-based)
  - Real-world exploitation techniques
  - Common HTML/JS injection points

- Watched [**DOM XSS Explained ‚Äì InsiderPhD**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6uPHcLj4oU), which covered:
  - What DOM XSS is and how it differs from reflected XSS
  - The concept of sources and sinks
  - How JavaScript handles and processes user-controlled input

- Watched [**Live Bug Bounty Demo ‚Äì XSS in Real Target**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecuiE83zvqY), which showed:
  - How to identify input points and test payloads
  - Tips for finding XSS in modern JS-heavy apps
  - Using Burp Suite effectively to test for XSS

## üß† What I Learned

- The **difference between Reflected, Stored, and DOM-based XSS**.
- How **HTML injection context** impacts whether a payload executes.
- DOM-based XSS occurs when **JavaScript processes user input directly**, without proper sanitization.
- CSP (Content Security Policy) is a security layer that can be bypassed if misconfigured ‚Äî learned how to test those bypasses.
- How to **identify JavaScript sources (e.g., `location`, `document.referrer`) and sinks (e.g., `innerHTML`, `eval`)** in web applications.
- How to manually test XSS using **Burp Suite**, inspect server responses, and inject payloads to trigger JavaScript execution.
